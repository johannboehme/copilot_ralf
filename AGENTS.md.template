# Project Agent Instructions

> Copy this file to your project as `AGENTS.md` and customize it.
> The Ralph Loop agent reads this file at the start of every iteration.

## Project Overview

<!-- Describe your project in 2-3 sentences -->

## Tech Stack

<!-- List frameworks, languages, and key dependencies -->

## Code Conventions

<!-- Describe naming conventions, file structure, patterns to follow -->

## Verification Commands

Run these after every change. Also used as the automatic healthcheck between iterations:

<!-- ralph:verify:start -->
```bash
# Tests
npm test          # or: pytest, go test ./..., cargo test, etc.

# Linting
npm run lint      # or: ruff check, golangci-lint run, etc.

# Type checking
npx tsc --noEmit  # or: mypy ., etc.

# Build
npm run build     # or: go build, cargo build, etc.
```
<!-- ralph:verify:end -->

## Important Rules

- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Write tests for new functionality
- Don't modify configuration files unless explicitly required
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Use machine-verifiable acceptance criteria (e.g. "npm test passes", not "works correctly")
